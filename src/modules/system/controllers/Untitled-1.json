Use LLE Mii selector applet (or HLE but I haven't PRed it yet)\r\n2. Compile MSVS build from master\r\n3. Open game, do anything that opens the Mii selector applet\r\n4. Stop the game\r\n5. Start any game again\r\n6. Open Mii selector applet again\r\n7. Citra crashes\r\n\r\nThe crash happens in both Release and Debug builds.\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce this in the Mingw Canary builds.\r\n\r\nLog: https://pastebin.com/Yvu1XAiA\r\nCall stack:\r\n![unbenannt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20753089/52534917-fd78ef80-2d47-11e9-878d-2de3f6699759.PNG)\r\n\r\nWhen testing the HLE applet, it can be observed, that the second time, when it crashes `capture_info.size` is 0. \r\n\r\nFor LLE mii applet, the size parameter in SVC::CreateMemoryBlock from the callstack is also 0 on the second run.\r\n\r\nHLE software keyboard doesn't seem to be affected by this."

It leaves many wasted black screen in laptop which give impression that the screen looks small.\r\n\r\nOne of the nice features from DeSmuME Core in RetroArch is Hybrid Screen. It use unused screen area to show the entire DS Screen, so user can see the whole DS experience while enjoying bigger resolution for one of its screen. The Hybrid Screen can be illustrated as this:\r\n\r\n![desmume 360x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4508389/41812537-e1561f58-774e-11e8-9d46-ffeb07abebfd.png)\r\n\r\nThis hybrid method will have at least 3 advantages:\r\n1. We can see the full experience of 3DS screen while enjoying bigger screen preview,\r\n2. It looks symmetrical that give impression that the entire laptop screen has filled with game display.\r\n3. The zoomed screen can be swapped by hotkeys.\r\n\r\nThis is one of mock up that I made from FE Awakening.\r\n![citra](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4508389/50570196-2c4b8f80-0db2-11e9-9488-75357bd94b15.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention."

I don't have an issue at the moment, but I do have a request for a feature in Citra that would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if you could integrate Discord into Citra so people could Discord chat with whoever they're playing with, without having to get each other's usernames. Maybe the way it would work is people would enter their Discord username into Citra when first installing it, and then whenever they join a room, they could choose to get either text or voice chat or both before the join process starts. Or maybe instead of entering your Discord username manually, it would sync with the Discord app.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

I could then disconnect the Xbox controller and connect any other Xinput controller and as long as it is in slot 0 (Player 1) it will work.\r\nIn citra it seems to bind the controls per controller, that is once I set up an Xbox controller, another Xinput device cannot be used unless I rebind the controls again.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is a problem for me is because I prefer certain controllers for certain games. Xbox One for comfort, DS4 for motion controls and touch, SN30 Pro for side scrollers. All of these can use Xinput, and by binding input to the controller slot, emulators will automatically work with any of them without any configuration required."

This could lead to people making codes that don't work or only work half of the time or just overcomplicate the process. I'd really enjoy such a feature and would be willing to test it out.

While Citra is open, it's possible to change it back because the program will keep using the GPU it has been opened on.\r\n\r\nMy request is a parameter in Citra's Graphics settings to choose between available GPU devices.

        "body": "So, I read on a progress report of Citra that New Super Mario Bros. 2's Multiplayer worked and I thought to give it a try myself as I never played a Mario game in Co-op before. I contacted a friend of mine and we decided a room in which we'll play it. However, to our great surprise, whenever we tried to connect with each other in-game, the game started telling that the other person left the game. No one of us had left the game in reality. \r\n\r\nFirst, this seemed a room bug to us, but we tried every room there was available and got the same results. It was a really weird issue that happened with me... Every other game I played on Multiplayer before (including Mario Party : The Top 100) worked fine. \r\n\r\nOne more info, He and I tried to be both Mario and Luigi, however, none of them worked, It detected us in game, but (When Mario) clicking on start game or (When Luigi) clicking on Which Mario to play with and waiting a few seconds, both player get the message that the other one left.\r\n\r\nI am attaching the log file below. Please report if you find the issue and the workaround. \r\n[citra_log.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2576334/citra_log.txt)\r\n"

I will appreciate any temporal one:\r\n1. It happens after >50 battles [>50 changed stages loading? >50 AI actors loading?]\r\n2. At the beginning only 2 stages become a little bit slower\r\n3. After every ~10 battles slow arenas become slower, other arenas become affected to.\r\n\r\nWhat I have already tried:\r\n1. Cleaning ram standby list by RAMMap utility\r\n2. Turning on Accurate Geometry shader\r\n3. Turning on both Accurate Geometry shader & Accurate Multiplication\r\n4. Changing sound settings [auto, cubeb, null]\r\n5. Deleting *.info from debugging settings in case of console leakage.\r\n6. Testing with older citra HEAD-54390d5\r\n\r\nLog files from recently Nightly 1095:\r\n[citra_log-auto1.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568892/citra_log-auto1.txt)\r\n[citra_log-auto2.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568893/citra_log-auto2.txt)\r\n[citra_log-auto3.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568894/citra_log-auto3.txt)\r\n[citra_log-cubeb.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568895/citra_log-cubeb.txt)\r\n[citra_log-cubeb-stretch.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568896/citra_log-cubeb-stretch.txt)\r\n[citra_log-null-exit.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568897/citra_log-null-exit.txt)\r\n[citra_log-null-occur.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2568898/citra_log-null-occur.txt)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCPU jit,\r\n![citra configuration 2018-11-11 02 16 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20445390/48307266-4e672500-e55a-11e8-989a-bc3baa3aba8b.png)\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n1) Pentium G2020 [it's only 2 cores 2,9GHz and citra is amazingly runs on it. Citra rocks!))]\r\n2) Nvidia GT610 [no Vulkan support and still citra is great!]\r\n3) Win7 x64\r\n\r\nExtra1:\r\n- I remember exactly the same behavior in ppsspp about 4-5 years ago, when Tekken 6 firstly became playable. Someone of devs who was working at that time fixed it and shared some news about - calling it a memory leakage that was very hard to find. [Already tried to google it. It might be erased or somewhere deep.]\r\n\r\nExtra2:\r\n- a game is already wonderful to play. Compared to known Tekken 6 it brings adjusted AI, and firstly in a Tekken series forces a player to train in survival modes under different rules like reduced hp, or only juggle damage. It's Ultra Hard AI, new music, new stages, recreated models, different lighting system, low-polygon style combines all of this in a unique 3ds way\r\n\r\nAnd that is why every citra player will experience slowdowns. There is a lot of 40-battles survival modes, which player will try again & again to accomplish. Also there is 100-battles survival mode which might also lead with game progress to a new one 100-battle survival mode, and a new one.\r\n\r\nRight now everything is perfect for 10-stages quick battle [4-5 times] or with combining it with 10-stages survival mode. In case of any long survival 40-battles survival mode it's better firstly to restart an emu.\r\n\r\nExtra3:\r\n- after some time will test it in Ubuntu. It's very interesting to know how linux Mesa drivers will behave on specified old hardware.\r\n\r\n[probably should have notice that I am foreigner, I am sorry if I said something wrong, I am open for learning, and still improving social and language skills. Thank you for development of 3ds emulator on github!]"

Unless I'm really not understanding something.\r\n\r\nI need that because I'm creating a Portage ebuild for Citra, which is best based on downloading a release source from github archives and building it.\r\n\r\nPS: the tar.gz also contains a \"citra-nightly-nightly-version\" directory, forcing me to additionally rename it on unpacking or tweak other parts of the build process."

This includes any framerate stuttering / audio slowdowns and the like that can occur even on powerful gaming PCs.\r\n\r\nGiven that Citra can now record and play back gameplay in the form of TAS \"movies,\" and that Citra has always been able to emulate at less-than-realtime speeds, a new approach to producing gameplay video may be possible: record gameplay to a CTM file, suffering whatever random stutters/slowdowns come up, and then once the recording is complete, let Citra chew on it for a while and churn out a perfectly smooth video file.\r\n\r\nNon-real-time rendering allows for the final video to be better [than a screen recording] in other respects, too: it can be a higher resolution than the PC comfortably supports, it can use accurate software shaders for everything, etc. The rendering can even take place on a system different from the one on which the gameplay was originally recorded.\r\n\r\nPresumably, an initial implementation of this feature would produce a straight uncompressed video file, which would be enormous, and only good for passing in to a video encoder like FFmpeg/Handbrake/etc. to get it to a reasonable (YouTube-uploadable) size. A later iteration could do some sort of integration with such tools so that Citra hands off only a few frames at a time, reducing the disk space overhead required."

        "body": "I was asked to report that issue although I couldn't observe it myself due to the lack of a problematic controller:\r\n\r\nDue to the changes added to support controller hotplugging Citra opens a connection to all connected controllers on startup. Some controllers (mainly some mayflash adapters) cause a crash inside SDL. This will result in an instant crash of citra without any log.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this issue for now is to unplug the controller/adapter. The controller wouldn't work for Citra anyway.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation why SDL causes the crash is necessary. E.g. running it with a debugger while such controller is connected and then looking at the stack trace could be a first hint. This would require the dev to look at the issue to have such troublesome controller (which I'm not).\r\n\r\nThere are two solutions to that issue:\r\n1. Don't open all controllers at startup: This would prevent Citra from crashing but Citra would crash when someone tries to configure such controller.\r\n\r\n2. Figure out the main reason why SDL crashes and upstream the fix to SDL\r\n"

The issue is that Citra doesn't recognize the joysticks on the joy cons as joysticks. You can still set them up manually, but the direction isn't as smooth as if it were a configured joystick. In the controls, it recognizes them as Hat 0 up/down/left/right. I'd like it if someone could make the sticks configurable.

        "body": "**EDIT: Just now I restored my game from a backup in a different folder, but need to report this so it could be fixed. Also, the log is from when the save was replaced, too late to undo it now.**\r\n\r\n- **Issue**:\r\nI was playing Pokemon: Alpha Sapphire for a long time yesterday, and lost a lot of progress. The previous save was from the left side (2nd floor Apartment Complex field) of Mauville City, the new save is from the Fallarbor Town top field, and the loaded save is from Slateport City beach. That's a lot of progress I lost! All I did was save properly (I save tons of times throughout important events/times), and shutdown properly (sometimes I 'Quit' emulation, sometimes I exit the Citra window through 'X'). Unless closing the window (even after you've saved multiple times) corrupts the save file, nothing else makes sense. I was on Build 990, problem occurred (_maybe it did in older builds, I wouldn't remember_), updated to 993 to potentially fix the issue, but it didn't.\r\n\r\n- **Log**: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DK8d7NhSw5hkMe9yl3P26Cpq3FxFwNwy\r\n\r\n- **Hardware**: GIGABYTE GA-AB350M-Gaming 3 (Rev. 1.0), AMD Ryzen 7 1700X @3.89GHz, 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4 3200MHz, HIS/AMD Radeon R9 290 4GB GDDR5, Samsung SM953 Series MZ-1WV4800 480GB M.2 SSD (OS/apps), 4TB HDD (roms/installed on), 2TB HDD (PC games).\r\n\r\n- **Game Save**: [irrelevant because I replaced the non-working one with the working one, works **now**.]\r\n\r\n- **Screenshots**: [irrelevant because there are no graphical problems.]\r\n\r\nThis issue was occurring around 990, and still continues to 993 today. It may have happened in previous builds, but I wouldn't remember. I'm linking my last issue in case someone asks about deleting the **sdmc** folder or not.\r\nhttps://github.com/citra-emu/citra/issues/4236\r\n"

        "body": "Some of this is discussed in the original pull request #3632, but I thought it'd be better to open a new issue and list the settings I think are missing.\r\n\r\n### Option to switch left and right images\r\nThis will make it possible to see 3D using the [cross-eyed method](http://www.vision3d.com/3views.html). Currently, the image intended for the left eye is shown on the left side of the screen, and the right eye one on the right. The cross-eyed method requires them to be reversed.\r\n\r\n### Option to disable squashing/stretching\r\nThe current output is currently squashed to half its width, which is how 3D monitors and TVs often expect to get a side-by-side 3D image. However, again, this is bad for the cross-eyed method and even the parallel method, as both methods depend on having two natural-looking images side by side.\r\n\r\n### Different 3D output options\r\nThe following methods (see also: http://www.stereo3d.com/formats.htm and Wikipedia links below) are used by various different 3D display technologies:\r\n1. Side by side (only method currently implemented in Citra)\r\n2. Top and bottom - for many passive 3D displays, this would result in no data loss, while side by side has 50% of the pixels discarded by the monitor.\r\n3. Line interlacing - odd lines are left image & even lines are right image, or vice versa. Used by many passive 3D displays.\r\n4. [Column interlacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier) - I'm not sure if this is actually used by any technology on the market (other than the 3DS itself!), but if you implement line interlacing I would think that column interlacing would be trivial to add. Better safe than sorry!\r\n5. [Anaglyph 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D) - red/cyan, and perhaps tweakable/selectable colors? This would definitely be the lowest priority IMO, I don't think it would be fun to play.\r\n6. [Alternate frame sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shutter_3D_system) - every monitor refresh switches to the other eye. This is used by active shutter 3D glasses, such as Nvidia 3D. Of course, switching back and forth between the two images must be v-synced and independent of the game's framerate.\r\n\r\nI ordered them in the order of what I think would be easiest to implement to hardest. As it always is, the frame stacking method (hardest) is probably the most important / would have the most users."

Here, running Citra and starting a game, or restarting a game in an already open instance of Citra, will be considered a \"session\". In a session, after a varying amount of time (Reports have varied from immediate, to minutes, to hours after starting the session.), emulation will see a drastic reduction in performance.

        "body": "This issue was first discussed on the Citra forum: `(https://community.citra-emu.org/t/citra-and-steam-link-halve-game-speed-and-fps-when-citra-is-active-window/44602)`\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate it if someone could help out and or offer some insight or a work around.\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\n\r\nHello! Been trying to get Citra working over steam link, but I’m running into a mighty odd problem. I went through both the Citra forum and the steam forum but to no avail. The symptom, as best I can describe is, is as followed:\r\n\r\nIt looks like Citra is being forced to run at half its speed when using steam link and while it’s the active window, it shows ~50% ~15 FPS in the bottom right corner and ~30 FPS on TV. I say “Citra as active window”, because when I change the active window on the desktop PC, or simply open the windows start menu, it goes nicely up to ~100% and ~30 FPS and the TV goes to ~ 60FPS.\r\n\r\nWhat is especially odd to look at is to open task manager on the CPU usage and switch between the Citra window and Task manager and see the FPS shift. At 100% game speed there is around 60% CPU usage, when Citra is the active window and the game goes to 50%, the CPU usage is about 35%.\r\n\r\nSome things that I have tried, but did not help:\r\n\r\n-  Run Citra outside of steam link, games work fine, controller works fine.\r\n- Configured Citra as non steam game, directly opening the game\r\n- Tried two different games Zelda MM and Zelda LBW, both have this issue\r\n- Other non steam games work find through Steam link (played Talos Principle and CEMU Zelda BOTW), appear normal/OK\r\n- Disconnected second monitor\r\n- Updated AMD drivers, tried 18.5.1 and 18.8.1 (latest)\r\n- Tried both regular and beta steam clients\r\n- Tried running games uncapped at 200%, desktop only, the games go to about 150-170%, trough steam link, fastest is ~50%\r\n- Making a different window active, makes game run normal speed 100% 30 FPS, 60 FPS on steam link\r\n- V-sync is off in Citra and AMD global settings\r\n- Killed Steam link on the television, while still running on the desktop, when setting Citra as the active window, the speed remains at 100% and 30 FPS. When reconnecting the stream (apparently that’s possible) the problem returns.\r\n- Tried other various settings for max speed performance etc. I read a Steam link forum post about steam link capping a program when it notices it runs at low FPS at first or somewhere during play.\r\n-  Tried setting CPU affinity for Citra to 0-3 and Steam to 4 - 7, no effect\r\n- Set desktop PC power plan to ‘High Performance’\r\n- The steam link encoding threads was set to automatic. I set it to 1, restarted everything, but no improvement…\r\n- I originally started out with the Steam Link on software encoding, but switched on the setting for hardware encoding with my AMD graphics card. Also to no effect… \r\n\r\nAs a workaround I have been looking in to setting a different active window and try playing, however the controller then controls the mouse and you can, for example, scroll down pages in an internet browser… but not actually play the game.\r\n\r\n**System Information**\r\n\r\n    Operating System: Windows 10 Pro, recently updated\r\n    CPU: Intel Core i7 960 @ 3.2 Ghz\r\n    GPU: AMD Radeon R9 380\r\n    Citra Version (found in title bar): Nightly #925 (latest)\r\n    Game: Zelda MM, Zelda LBW, Zelda OoT\r\n\r\n**Screenshot of Issue**\r\n\r\nCitra as active window, Steam link on, screenshot of Desktop:\r\n\r\n![citra-active-window-steam-link-on](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14330834/44631879-9d95b480-a972-11e8-9aa0-07696a76d2d7.png)\r\n\r\nTask manager as active window, Steam link on, screenshot of Desktop, showing CPU usage after switching active windows back and forth.\r\n\r\n![citra-toggle-window-steam-link-on-cpu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14330834/44631882-a71f1c80-a972-11e8-84e4-afcf18963233.png)\r\n\r\nCitra as active window, Steam link on, photo of TV:\r\n\r\n![img_20180826_115005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14330834/44631894-d0d84380-a972-11e8-9155-910abbea66dd.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe steam menu, running normal at 60 FPS.\r\n\r\n![img_20180826_114923](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14330834/44631885-b736fc00-a972-11e8-9779-9fe7a79055c4.jpg)\r\n\r\nCitra running the game at 100%, 30 FPS, Steam link at 60 FPS when task manager is the active window:\r\n\r\n![img_20180826_115529](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14330834/44631899-dcc40580-a972-11e8-8bdb-503ce8c3d81d.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Logs**\r\n\r\n[streaming_log.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2321805/streaming_log.txt)\r\n[citra_log.txt](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/files/2321806/citra_log.txt)\r\n"
